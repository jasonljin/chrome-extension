As an AI language model, I am unable to create or generate image files directly. However, I can guide you on how to create the icon16.png file for your Chrome Extension.

1. Use an image editor like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool like Canva or Figma.
2. Create a new image with dimensions 16x16 pixels.
3. Design your icon according to the theme of your Chrome Extension (Communication Coach for Slack).
4. Save the image as a PNG file with the filename "icon16.png".
5. Place the "icon16.png" file inside the "icons" folder in your Chrome Extension project directory.

Remember to also create the other icon sizes (icon48.png and icon128.png) following the same steps but with dimensions 48x48 and 128x128 pixels, respectively.
