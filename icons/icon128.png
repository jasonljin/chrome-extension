As an AI language model, I cannot directly create or provide image files like icons/icon128.png. However, I can guide you on how to create the icon for your Chrome Extension.

You can create a 128x128 pixel icon using any image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva or Figma. Save the image in PNG format and name it "icon128.png". Place the image file in the "icons" folder within your Chrome Extension project directory.
